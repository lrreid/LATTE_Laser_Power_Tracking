# LATTE Laser Power Tracking
 Python GUI for saving sets of laser power measurements and plotting the history of the measurements

Each day, a set of measurements are recorded when the LATTE laser is switched on. This GUI makes it easier to save the measurements into a text file.
This text file is then used to plot the history of the measurements which is used to closely monitor the preformance of the laser and help inform decision making for when periods of maintanence should be undertaken. For instance if we can see that the pulse energy out of the regen is constant but the energy out of the multipass amplifier is falling each day then perhaps it is time to replace the Powerlite laser flashlamps.
